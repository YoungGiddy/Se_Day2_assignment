Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
            Tracking changes
            Repository 
            Commits
            Branches

Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps, and what are some of the important decisions you must make during this process?
            1.login to github
            2.navigate to new repository
            3.fill in the repository details
            4.click "create  repository"
Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
                   1. Used for prject introduction
                   2. Collaboration and contribution
                   3.Project visibility
Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?
               private repository: -only repository owners and those allowed can view the content
                                   -access restricted to authorzed users
                                   _ideal for sensitive work
               Public repository: -any one on the internet can view the contents
                                  -users can clone, fork and contribute to it
                                  -ideal for sharing and collaboration
Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?        A commit is a snapshot of your project at a particular given time
         they help in tracking changes in that: they enable comparisons
                                                They record differences
                                                Takes snapshots of files states
          steps :
          1.initialize a git repository
          2.Add files to the staging area
          3.Commit your changes

Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?
          They serve as a structured way to propose , review and intergrate code changes.
          1. Creaye a branch
          2.Make changes and commit
          3.Push the branch to github
          4.Create the pull request on github
          5.merge the pull request
Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?
   This is creating your own copy of someone elses repository.
        forking create a copy on github whereas cloning creates a copy on your computer.
        how is forking useful: 1 experinemting and learning
                               2 creating your own versions
Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
          1. Understanding git concepts -Read git documentation
          2.Git command line complexity- start with the basics
